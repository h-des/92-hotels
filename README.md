# 92-hotels

92-hotels is a fake app that allows you to find a room in a hotel, check availability and book it.

## Description

This repository contains 2 versions of 92-hotels app.

First one is only a client-side app (more like a mockup) built with **React** and **Redux** working with 2 external APIs:

You can [access this version here](https://github.com/h-des/92-hotels/tree/master) or just switch to `master` branch.

The second version is more compound. It's a **node** + **express** + **mongoose** server build from scratch connected to a database populated with data from external APIs and random data from faker.js and a client-side app built with **React** and **Redux**. You can [access this version here](https://github.com/h-des/92-hotels/tree/server-and-client) or just switch to `server-and-client` branch.
